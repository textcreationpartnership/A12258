            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I acknowledge my ſins,<note place="margin">

            <p>Firſt, I confeſſe, that I was created to thy Image, but ſinne hath ſo diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and defaced it in me, that there appeareth no print thereof in my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I was white as the ſnowe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.23</note> but am become blacke as the More: my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is as a menſtruous garment.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſa.</hi> 64.6.</note> Reſtore thine Image in me, and repare thy ruinous building. Thine honour ſhall bee greatter in reforming, than in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2568:12"/>forming me: as in my reſurrection thy glorie ſhall kythe more than in my creation. The liberalitie of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe appeared when as thou ſtamped ſuch graces in my nature: but thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which indure for euer, may bee ſeene when thou reneweſt thoſe gifts, which I haue prodigallie waſted and ſpent vpon ſinne. Transforme mee, O Lord, to thy ſimilitude; that as thou art holy, wiſe, mercifull, patient, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, &amp;c. ſo I may repreſent thee (in ſome meaſure) in them all. As for mine infancie,<note place="margin">Mans ſtate in infancie.</note> I knowe not what I was: a poore Suckling, vpon my Mothers Breaſtes: I could no wayes helpe my ſelfe, but by weeping. I was caſten vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee from the wombe: by thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence I was kept, and thine Angels guarded mee. But this I know, that an Infant of one day, is not cleane before thee: haue mercy vpon mee, therefore, O my God, and by the holy infancie of my Sauiour, I beſeech thee, aboliſh whatſoeuer guiltineſſe I haue contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in my Childhood, euen from my birth.<note place="margin">Childhood.</note> Then I grew a Childe, which I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2568:12"/>doe well remember: &amp; the poyſonable roote of ſinne, which lay hid in mine infancie, ſprang foorth in my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. And then (for as little as I was) I began to diſdaine, yea, to ſnite my fellowes. I had no delight to pray, nor heare thy word, albeit my Parents and Maſters many times did commaund mee. I ſpent that time, euen the firſt fruites of my youth, in ydleneſſe. My ſinfull life, and wicked nature, deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to bee inſtructed in learning and vertue: which my neglect of time is nowe puniſhed in mine age, for the which I craue thy mercy. O remember not, good Lord, the ſinnes of my youth: neither howe ignorant I haue beene of thy trueth.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.7.</note> But by the holy childhood of thy Sonne, purge the ſinnes of my childhood: and of thy great mercy. O Lord, pittie mine ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
            <p>But when I paſſed the yeeres of my childhood,<note place="margin">Adoleſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> I entered into mine Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcencie, in a middle age, betwixt a Boy and a Man. Alace, for pittie! when I call to minde that time of my life, my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2568:13"/>ſoule is aſtoniſhed; fearing that thou wilt make mee to inherite the ſinnes of my youth. Thou gaueſt mee ſtrength of bodie, and quickneſſe of minde: but how vyldlie abuſed I all thy benefites? I with the prodigall ſonne, haue ſpent all my precious youth in ſinne. Oh, when I thinke vpon the monethes of vanitie, when I gaue my ſtrength to ſinne, and did conſecrate the firſt fruits of my life to Sathan, my ſoule fainteth. O Lord, I am aſhamed when I thinke vpon my lende and beaſtly behauiour; more beſeeming a Beaſt, than a Man. O Lord, thou haſt not ſuffered all my follies to be made patent to the world, neither didſt thou ſlay me in my ſinne. Let not my ſecrete ſinnes ſtand in the light of thy countenance: for thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is to couer ſinnes: therefore, let them paſſe like a ſhaddow. If <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did pardon thoſe ſinnes of his Brethren, wilt thou,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.1.</note> O Lord, call to minde the follies by the which I haue offended thee? Alace, I was not onely fooliſh, and inſolent, but I was mad: I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all admonitions of thy ſeruauntes:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2568:13"/>I thought my Parentes, and Elders, were but fooliſh; and I euaniſhed in my mad rage. I was nigh vnto the gates of Hell: I poſted, and ranne, as ſwiftly as the Dromadarie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.24.</note> or the wilde Aſſe. But thou tookeſt mee in my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: and when I was ladened with ſinne, then thou mercifully chaſtiſedſt mee: while I was burning in the flame of my luſtes, thou tamedſt mee by a grieuous diſeaſe, and ſickneſſe, which thou layedſt vpon mee; by which my bodie was brought vnder. Bleſſed bee thou, O Lord, who hadſt that care of mee, that thou chaſtiſedſt me, and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turedſt mee, that I ſhould not periſh with the wicked worlde. Thou didſt meete thy ſeruant <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee went to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 9.3.</note> and ſmoteſt him to the ground with blindneſſe, that he might riſe againe a new man, to honour thee. Thou diddeſt preuent <hi>Dauid,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Abigall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.23.</note> who ſtopped him from ſheeding of blood. O moſt mercifull Lord, thou didſt meete mee by thy rodde, and didſt caſt mee downe, and rayſedſt mee vp againe. Before I was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2568:14"/>afflicted I went aſtray: but now I haue learned to followe thy Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.67.</note> Now I thy poore Supplicant, vpon the knees of a ſorrowfull ſoule, craue pardon, and grace, for all the tranſgreſſions of my youth.</p>
            <p>But, O my God, as I grew in yeeres, ſo I grew in ſinne,<note place="margin">Age.</note> and I forgot thy former mercies. I went to <hi>Iericho,</hi> and mine enemies wounded mee vpon the way,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk</hi> 10.33</note> and left me for dead: my fellowes paſſed by mee, but gaue mee no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. But thou, O pittifull <hi>Samaritane,</hi> hadſt mercy vpon mee: thou filledſt my woundes with the wine of thy blood: thou powredſt in the oyle of thy ſpirit to ſoften them: thou tookeſt mee vpon thy ſhoulders, and brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt mee to the Inne of thy Church, where I might remaine vntill I was perfectly cured. Prayſe bee vnto my God, who left mee not in my ſinne, but had compaſſion vpon mee. But, Lord, haue pittie, for my ſoule is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly tormented, when I thinke on my former dayes, and how I haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt thee.</p>

            <p>Next, vpon the Sabbath it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that our hearts and affections be ſpirituallie diſpoſed, with a delight and pleaſure in the Lord. Heerefore the Lord craueth by his Prophet that his Sabbath ſhould be a day of delight:<note place="margin">

Thou haſt aſſiſted thy Church euen from the begining, and for the deliuerie of the ſame thou haſt plagued her cruell perſecuters from time to time.

Nowe therefore, O Lord, when I looke backe to my former life, and conſider the ſinnes of my childhood, and mine age, what things I did ignorantlie, and what I did againſt mine owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, my forgetfulneſſe of thy mercies,
